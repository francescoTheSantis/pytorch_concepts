Concept Bottleneck Generative Model (CB-VAE) on Color-MNIST.

Where a CBM/CEM runs ``input -> latent -> concepts -> tasks``, a concept
bottleneck *generative* model runs the other way: ``Z -> C -> X``. A latent
``z ~ N(0, I)`` produces per-concept context embeddings, each concept is
decoded from its own embeddings, the embeddings are mixed by the predicted
concept probabilities (exactly the CEM mixture), and the resulting bottleneck
``w = [w_1, ..., w_k, w_unk]`` is decoded back into the image. The extra
``w_unk`` is the *unsupervised* context: the capacity the pre-defined concepts
do not cover.

Inference is variational: a Pyro guide ``q(z | x)`` supplies the encoder
direction, so the model trains with two extra terms beyond the usual
reconstruction and KL — a concept loss on the bottleneck's concept
probabilities and an orthogonality loss pushing the unsupervised context away
from the concept contexts.

Experiment settings:
- Dataset: Color-MNIST via ``ColorMNISTDataModule``, two categorical concepts
  (``digit`` 10-way, ``color`` 2-way), images flattened to 3x28x28 = 2352
  pixels modelled as a ``Delta`` observation — the decoder predicts the image
  and nothing else, scored by MSE.
- Model: ``ConceptBottleneckGenerativeModel`` with MLP encoder/decoder.
- Inference engine: Pyro ``VariationalInference`` with a guide on ``z``.
- Loss: a ``CompositeLoss`` of ``mse + kl + alpha * concept + beta * orthogonality``.

Expected outcome:
- The loss terms go down and both concept accuracies climb well above chance
  (0.1 for ``digit``, 0.5 for ``color``): about 0.94 and 1.00 after 30 epochs.
- The reconstruction grid written at the end shows recognisable coloured
  digits.
