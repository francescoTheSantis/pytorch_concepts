"""Shared machinery for ``analysis/run_generative_analysis.py``.

Four independent pieces, in the order the script uses them:

1. **Run discovery and rebuild** — find finished Hydra jobs on disk and
   reconstruct their datamodule + model from the config saved beside them.
2. **Modalities** — everything that knows what a *sample* is. An image today; a
   token sequence tomorrow. Metrics never touch raw model output, so adding a
   generative model over discrete data is one :class:`Modality` subclass and no
   change to any metric.
3. **Metrics** — each one a small class in :data:`METRICS`, taking an
   :class:`EvalContext` and returning ``{column_name: value}``. Adding a metric
   is one class plus one registry entry; nothing else moves.
4. **Results** — the per-run and seed-averaged CSVs.

The split that makes this extensible is between the *shape* of a metric and the
*modality* it is measured in. FID, for instance, is a Fréchet distance between
feature vectors — computed by ``torchmetrics`` — and only
:meth:`Modality.features` knows those come from an Inception network for images
and would come from a language model for text.
