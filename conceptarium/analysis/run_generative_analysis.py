"""Quantitative and qualitative analysis of trained generative concept models.

Post-hoc counterpart to ``run_experiment.py`` for the generative branch. It finds
every finished run matching ``filters``, rebuilds each from its saved config and
checkpoint, and writes one results tree:

    results/
      results.csv                                  one row per run
      results_by_model.csv                         mean/std over seeds
      qualitative/<dataset>/<model>/<run>/
          config.yaml                              the run's own config
          overview.png                             original / reconstruction / generation
          steering_<concept>.png                   one sample at every state of a concept

The metrics implement Ismail et al., "Concept Bottleneck Generative Models"
(ICLR 2024): **steerability** (Table 1) — does intervening on a concept put that
concept into the output, judged by a classifier trained on real data — and
**FID** (Table 2). Both live in :data:`~conceptarium.generative_utils.METRICS`;
adding another is one class and one registry entry, and needs no change here.

Everything modality-specific sits behind
:class:`~conceptarium.generative_utils.Modality`, so a generative model over
discrete data needs a subclass there and nothing in this file.

Runs are discovered by scanning ``search_dirs`` for directories holding both
``.hydra/config.yaml`` and a checkpoint. Notably *not* via ``runs.csv``: the
registry records absolute paths from the machine that trained the run and is
skipped entirely under ``debug: true``, so results copied in from a GPU box are
invisible to it. A run whose checkpoint will not load — an architecture change
since it was trained, usually — is reported and skipped rather than aborting the
rest.

Two engines are used, for different jobs: the model's own
:class:`~torch_concepts.nn.VariationalInference` is the only one that consults
the guide, so it does the encoding; an ancestral engine does every decode. They
share the same PGM by reference, so no weights are copied.

On speed: the guide runs the image backbone live and torchvision preprocessing
resizes to 224x224, so the test-set passes dominate. ``accelerator`` picks the
device; ``max_eval_batches`` caps those passes, and ``n_fid_samples`` /
``n_steering_samples`` the generative ones.
